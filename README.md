### Project 3 Background
In this project I used Tier 1 by making repository classes for all of the methods. These repository classes are used to connect to the database and read from it. These methods in the repository classes are then used inside my controllers in order to implement and use these methods when running the project. You can update, view, delete and create new items that will be added to the database.
